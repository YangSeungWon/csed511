CSED511 Introduction to Virtual Reality
Fall 2025
Assignment 3. Multimodal Interaction (VR Mini-Game)
This assignment extends your VR interaction pipeline to a simple target-shooting mini-game with synchronized visual + haptic (controller vibration) + audio feedback. You will implement spawning/destroying objects by shooting, provide multimodal feedback on trigger events, and design a scoring UI that distinguishes between target types.
Note. Target platform is VR (HMD + controllers recommended). 

Instructions
Use Unity 2021.3.6f1 or later. Implement the following features in your project.
Your virtual environment should be able to:
Game & Scene Setup (10)
Import three guns from the Unity Asset Store and place them in the scene.
Each gun must be grabbable using the controller's Grip button.
Shooting & Object Lifecycle (40)
Spawn targets at predefined times every 5 seconds; each target automatically self-destructs 5 seconds after it is spawned.
Spawn a bullet each time the gun is fired using a controller’s trigger button
Each of the three guns fires a different bullet color: red, blue, and white.
Destroy targets on collision with a bullet.
Multimodal Feedback (25)
Haptics: Trigger controller vibration with any vibration pattern when the gun fires.
Audio: Play any gunshot sound on fire.
Targets & Scoring UI (25)
Display a score UI in-world, updating immediately after each hit.
Implement three bullet-based scoring:
Red bullet: +50 points when destroying a target.
Blue bullet: +30 points when destroying a target.
White bullet: +10 points when destroying a target.

Evaluation Criteria (100 points)
Game & Scene Setup: 10 points
Shooting & Object Lifecycle: 40 points

Targets & Scoring UI: 25 points

Submission
Due date: Midnight (23:59:59), Nov. 3, 2025 
Submit by compressing your Unity project folder into a .zip file named: Assignment 3.zip
The zip file must include the Unity project folder (your implementation) and the exported Unity package file (`.unitypackage`), and a demo video (.mp4) that clearly shows implemented features. Note that the UI title must include your name (e.g., “Gildong”), and your name must also be visible inside the demo video.
Upload your file to your own shared drive and share the link with: kjw8515@postech.ac.kr
Do not modify your submission file after the due date. Any modification will be considered a late submission.
